# ResNeXt

Ikomia plugin to launch inference on ResNeXt classification model. Inference can be made from pre-trained model on ImageNet dataset or from custom trained model. Indeed you can use the [Ikomia ResNextTrain plugin](https://github.com/Ikomia-dev/ResNeXtTrain) to make the training. This plugin is based on [PyTorch torchvision implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).

### How to use it?
Here are the steps:

1. Create Ikomia account for free [here](https://ikomia.com/accounts/signup/) (if you don't have one)
2. Install [Ikomia software](https://ikomia.com/en/download)
3. Launch the software and log in with your credentials
4. Open Ikomia Store and install ResNeXt plugin
5. Open your images
